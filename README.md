# Handstand

| STOP!          |

| Do 5 push ups! | 

I always wanted to start a fitness book by illustrating to my readers that they probably fall into the classic trap of analysis paralysis. Otherwise they would have not pick this book up in the first place. Just do it!  
Now, with this out of the way, let me explain my motivation. 

## Motivation

When I was young, I was an obsessive athlete. Football, karate, krav maga, kick boxing, street workout, gymnastics. In this order, over a 15 years period. By the time I've bacam 18 my English skill started to be "ok", so I gradually gained access to more and more quality resources, those were not available to me, in my native language. I started to pay attention to my nutrition and read all of Lyle McDonald's books (by google tranlate every third word.) As my university studies become harder and harder I had to find more and more time efficient ways to exercise, so I got into street workout. I was doing that for a year, I was able to do muscle ups, human flags, a couple of seconds of handstands and handstand pushups on paralell bar. But I couldn't help but to think what I'm doing is ugly, especially my handstand.  
Just take a look at my form. It is probably one of the best illustrations on the internet of how to do handstand incorrectly.

This is when I turned to gymnastics, which as I thought about it at the time: "it's the correct way to do street workout." There were not many resources available at the time: Overcoming Gravity and GymnasticBodies Foundation series. I, for reasons I don't remember decided to start religiously follow the GymnasticBodies program. Although I was a little skeptical, because of the broscience feel and unethical marketing practices of the creators, I was very happy with it a couple of reasons: first: I didn't know anything about the proper techniques to execute the exercises and looking around me in the playground, nobody else knew, either. So I had some humility. Second: its simple programming and mastery templates made me consistently exercise for a year, without skipping any session. This was possible, not only because of psychological factors, but also, because its take it slow approach did not let me to get injured. Third: my forms drastically improved.  
Another problem with it was: my muscle mass went slightly down, due to the lack of eccentric movements in the program.  

Finally the GymnasticBodies Handstand One came out and I bought the program, it may had been the first digital product I bought in my life. Yes, I torrented everything else back then. It's not easy for a university student without any income. Interestingly the price of Handstand One was exactly how much money I spent in a whole month for food and everything else. Off topic aside, even though I was doing gymnastics training for a year already, my handstand did not improve much. Then I added Handstand One to my routine and started religiously following it. Then life happened and I stopped working on the Foundation Series, but I did not neglect my daily handstand practice. Fast forward a year later I was able to do a proper wall handstand. I was able to hold my freestanding handstand for around 30s at the time, though it was still not looking good.  
Nevertheless, it is not that impressive progression. You can see people learning stable handstands from zero within a year by simply trying to do handstand a lot, without any structured training program. Anyway that was not my goal in the first place. I knew I could've learn handstand in three months, but I didn't wanted a stable handstand that looks like mine in the photo above. I wanted to learn a proper one.  
Yet, I really thought I would be able to learn a stable and proper handstand within a year. Then life happend again. I started travelling and changing my home every two weeks, I got a new obsession and I wasn't able to stick to any training routine, let alone proper nutrition, during the next four years. Here I am now, 30kg heavier, a busy software developer, who changes his home every month and working from cafes all over the world.  
"But that's enough" - I said two weeks ago. I have to start doing something now. So I fired up my old GymnasticBodies account and started the Handstand One progressions, again. From the beginning. So where am I, you might ask. Two weeks ago, I wasn't even be able to hold the first progression for even a second, which is a headstand, but with resting the knees on the arms. Now I can go over one second, so I'm soon mastering it, yet, based on my previous experience I can't help, but to think, while this is a good way to learn handstand, it may not be optimal.  

This, and the my obsession with understanding and optimizing complex systems and solving difficult problems is the reason why I created this GitHub repository. I will research and build this handstand program on the fly, while I am progressing through it. I'm as far as, from being an expert as possible, so I don't recommend this program to anyone. Nevertheless, if you'd happen to like it, then feel free to contribute. Open a new issue or create a pull request.
