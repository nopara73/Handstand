# Handstand

## Goal

In the end of this tutorial, you will be able to hold a handstand for 30 seconds.

## Workout Structure

[Steven Low's book: Overcoming Gravity](http://stevenlow.org/overcoming-gravity/), recommends the following workout structure:  

1. [Warmup](Warmup/Warmup.md)
2. [Skill Work](SkillWork/SkillWork.md)
3. [Strength Work](StrengthWork/StrengthWork.md)
4. Endurance Work
5. [Flexibility Work](FlexibilityWork/FlexibilityWork.md)

Warmup prepares the body for workout. Working on skills is optimal after after Warmup, because it requres quality work. Strength Work is ideal, if the work is done with near maximal strength, which is most likely to be achieved after low intensity activities. The goal of Endurance Work is to endure an exercise for a longer period of time. It is nearly impossible to achieve near maximal strength after Endurance Work, which is the requirement for quality Strength Work, while endurance limits can still be effectively pushed after Strength Work.  
Doing endurance work for Handstand is generally unnecessary and leads to slower recovery.  
[According to Paul Ingraham](https://www.painscience.com/articles/stretching.php): Stretching research shows that static stretching is not an effective warmup, in fact it may even be harmful. [Lyle McDonalds came to similar conclusions](https://www.bodyrecomposition.com/muscle-gain/warming-up-for-the-weight-room-part-1.html/), however he also notes: many of the study protocols often donâ€™t really represent a realistic approach to training. It is most likely the best to do the relaxing stretching routine at the end of the workout to slowly cool down.
