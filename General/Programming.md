# Programming

Programming training routine based on Prilepinâ€™s table is widely used in Olympic lifting. [Steven Low recommends](http://stevenlow.org/the-fundamentals-of-bodyweight-strength-training/) [and adjusted](http://stevenlow.org/prilepin-tables-for-bodyweight-strength-isometric-and-eccentric-exercises/) the table for eccentric and isometric exercises.

Traditionally in gymnastics, in order to master an advanced exercise the trainee must go through progressions. 
Depending on the nature of a given progression, he either builds up the repetitions, or the duration of a hold. 
While this approach is often necessary, due to lack of leverage changing opportunity and/or equipment, it is not optimal. 
If it would be, weightlifters would rarely change their weights, rather they would try to work up the number of repetitions, before adding more weights. 
But they do the opposite. They start with higher repetitions and working towards lower repetitions, while progressively addig weights.  

The question is: how to use similar strategy in Gymnastics? In scenarios, when the leverage of the exercise can be easily changed, for example pushups, the exercise should start from easier leverage, higher repetitions, and gravitate towards lower repetitions, until it hits the one-two repetition wall and start over with higher repetitions again.  
Lacking of leverage, the exercise should be hardened with weights, if possible. Depending on the equipment at hand, creative solutions can be utilized to achieve the progressive overload.  
Finally, if neither changing leverage, nor adding weights or utilizing creative solutions can be done, the program defaults to repetitions or duration increase.
